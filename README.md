# upp-aggregate-healthcheck
The purpose of this service is to serve the functionality of aggregating healthchecks from services and pods in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage
 In this section, the aggregate-healthcheck functionalities are described.
### Get services health
 A service is considered to be healthy if it has at least one pod that is able to serve requests. To determine which pods are able to serve requests,
 there is a readinessProbe configured on each of them,  which checks the GoodToGo endpoint of the app running inside the pod. If the GoodToGo responds
 with a 503 Service Unavailable status code, the pod will not serve requests anymore, until it will receive 200 OK status code on GoodToGo endpoint.

 For a service, if there is at least one pod that can serve requests, the service will be considered healthy, but if there are pods that are unavailable,
 a message will be displayed in the "Output" section of the corresponding service.

 Not that for services are grouped into categories, therefore there is the possibility to query the aggregate-healthcheck only for a certain list of categories.
 If no category is provided, the healthchecks of all services will be displayed.

### Get pods health for a service
 Pods health is evaluated by querying the health endpoint of apps inside the pods. Given a pod, if there is at least one check that fails,
  the pod health will be considered warning or critical, based on the severity level of the check that fails.
### Acknowledge a service
 When a service is unhealthy, there is a possibility to acknowledge the warning. By acknowledging all the services that are unhealthy,
 the general status of the aggregate-healthcheck will become healthy (it will also mention that there are 'n' services acknowledged).
### Sticky categories
 Categories can be sticky, meaning that if one of the services become unhealthy, the category will be disabled, meaning that it will be unhealthy,
  until manual re-enabling it. There is an endpoint for enabling a category.
## Running locally
 There is a limited number of functionalities that can be used locally, because we are querying all the apps, inside the pods and there is no current
  solution of accessing them outside of the cluster, without using port-forwarding.
 The list of functionalities that can be used outside of the cluster are:
  * Add/Remove acknowledge
  * Enable/Disable sticky categories

## Endpoints
 In the following section, aggregate-healthcheck endpoints are described.
 Note that this app has two options of retrieving healthchecks:
  - `JSON format` - to get the results in JSON format, provide the `"Accept: application/json"` header
  - `HTML format` - this is the default format of displaying healthchecks.

### Service endpoints
 * `__health` - Perform services healthcheck.
    - params:
       - `categories` - the healthcheck will be performed on the services belonging to the provided categories.
       - `cache` - if set to false, the healthchecks will be performed without the help of cache. By default, the cache is used.
 * `__pods-health` - Perform pods healthcheck for a service.
    - params:
       - `service-name` - The healthcheck will be performed only for pods belonging to the provided service.
 * `__pod-individual-health` - Retrieves the healthchecks of the app running inside the pod.
    - params:
       - `pod-name` - The name of the pod for which the healthchecks will be retrieved.
 * `add-ack` - (POST) Acknowledges a service
    - params:
       - `service-name` - The service to be acknowledged.
    - request body:
       - `ack-msg` the acknowledge message.
 * `rem-ack` - Removes the acknowledge of a service
    - params:
       - `service-name` - The service to be updated.
 * `enable-category` - Enables a category. This is used for sticky categories which are unhealthy.
    - params:
       - `category-name` - The category to be enabled.
 * `disable-category` - Disables a category. This is useful when doing a failover.
    - params:
       - `category-name` - The category to be disabled.

### Admin endpoints
 * `__health`
 * `__gtg`
    - params:
       - `categories` - the healthcheck will be performed on the services belonging to the provided categories.
       - `cache` - if set to false, the healthchecks will be performed without the help of cache. By default, the cache is used.
    - returns a __503 Service Unavailable__ status code in the following cases:
       - if at least one of the provided categories is disabled (see sticky functionality)
       - if at least one of the checked services is unhealthy
    - returns a __200 OK__ status code otherwise
